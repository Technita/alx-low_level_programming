# 0x14. Bit Manipulation

This directory contains the c programs for the Alx_SE School Low Level Programming project on Bit Manipulation.

`The tasks are as follows:`

- binary_to_uint.c - Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- print_binary.c - Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- get_bit.c - Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- set_bit.c - Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- clear_bit.c - Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- flip_bits.c - Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
- get_endianness.c - Write a function that checks the endianness.
crackme3.c - Find the password for this program.

## Usage/Examples

The programs are written in C and use the following libraries:


```c headers
stdio.h
stdlib.h
```

To compile the programs, use the following commands:
```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename>.c -o <filename>

```

For example, to compile the binary_to_uint.c program, use the following command:
```
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 binary_to_uint.c -o binary_to_uint

```

To run the programs, use the following command:
```
./<filename>
```
